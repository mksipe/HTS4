# HTS4

#### Rationale

The HTS project was initially developed in one of my older repositories, shell-script-lib, outdated and used too many resources, and took too long to execute. This is the fourth official revision of this project to make finding specific tools, services, and other possibly unwanted services on your system.

### Current Status


> This project currently works if you understand how to use the clap rust library and cargo (will be documented later.)

I do not plan on maintaining this program. However if you read through the source code, the syntax of this program is not terribly complex, feel free to push a PR with some changes. 


## Dependencies

Cargo: `<package manager> install cargo -y`
