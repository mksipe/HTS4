# HTS4

HTS Version R4.1

#### Rationale

The HTS project was initially developed in one of my older repositories, shell-script-lib, outdated and used too many resources, and took too long to execute. This is the fourth official revision of this project to make finding specific tools, services, and other possibly unwanted services on your system.

### Current Status

This project is a WIP and probably will be until I feel comfortable deploying this long term. 

## Dependencies

Cargo: `apt install cargo -y`

## Installation

git: `git clone https://github.com/mksipe/HTS4`
